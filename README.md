# OPP-SCHOOL-LIBRARY-APP

Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that I created will allow you to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
